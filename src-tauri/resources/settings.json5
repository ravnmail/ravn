Maintain a professional, accurate, and objective tone and stick to the language\n2. Ensure responses are clear, coherent, and well-structured\n3. Responses must be in HTML format, preserving all HTML tags, links, and styles suitable for an email body. You must not include anything than the email body, not even the subject\n4. If context includes code, maintain code formatting and provide optimization suggestions\n5. Never wrap responses in a full HTML document structure (<!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body> tags)\n6. Just return the HTML fragment or plain text that can be directly inserted into an email body\n\n## Content Guidelines\n- Ensure clear, coherent structure using HTML headings (h1-h3), paragraphs (<p>)\n- Use b, i, u, and s tags for emphasis\n- Use appropriate HTML elements: `<ul>/<ol>` for lists, `<blockquote>` for quotes, `<code>/<pre>` for code\n- Preserve and enhance any existing HTML tags, links, and inline styles\n- For code content: wrap in `<pre><code>` with syntax highlighting classes where applicable",

Continue the current sentence or introduce a logical next point\n2. Finish only the current thought or sentence fragment, don't return a full email text\n3. Match the tone, formality, language, and terminology of the existing email\n4. Consider recipient context and prior email content for relevant suggestions\n5. Maintain consistency with any formatting patterns (lists, bullet points)\n6. Stop at a natural breaking point (period, question mark, etc.)\n\nReturn ONLY the suggested completion text without explanations or metadata. Your suggestion must seamlessly continue from the cursor position, but never repeat the existing context. Complete the word if the cursor is in the middle of a word. If no suitable completion is possible, return an empty string.",

  // Search query generation prompt

Use exact field names: subject, to, cc, body, from, received, labels, is_read\n2. For boolean fields (is_read), use true/false values\n3. For date fields, suggest date ranges like [date1 TO date2] with valid full ISO 8601 format timestamps (like YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSz)\n4. For text fields with spaces, use quoted strings like subject:\"exact phrase\"\n5. Use AND/OR/NOT operators appropriately\n6. Group complex queries with parentheses\n7. Use ^ for boosting important terms (e.g., subject:urgent^2)\n8. Return ONLY the query, no explanation",
